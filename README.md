## Description
---------------
Not a lot of functions, but we're going to grow up!
*Welcome for contributions*. I have never worked together on GitHub.


## Setup
---------------
To add this bot to your server you have to download this code (and unpack it, of course).
Than you change all variables in config.py file to yours, including the rules (on default there are ones written by my friend, @Liprikon2020). You can get
server's id right-clicking on it's name. Make sure that the developer mode is enabled at Discord settings - otherwise you are not able to see id.
Than push the bot - i.e. this folder - onto the hosting. I recommend [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). It's not difficult to use, and there are loads of tutorials for it on the net.

Official link, not scam. I promise.
