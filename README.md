## Description
---------------
This bot was done to make some tasks easy-to-do for the server's admin <br/>
and probably bring some fun ðŸ˜‹ <br/>

## In progress
---------------
Unfortunately, I am incredibly busy and I often have no time to work <br/>
on this project. Changes appear ***really*** slowly.

## Setup
---------------
To use this bot you should run this code using your personal id and <br/>
token. Just look up on the net for more information. Put your own values in config.py
